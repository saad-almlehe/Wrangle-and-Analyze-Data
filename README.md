# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data


In this project I will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.Also I will document my wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, A after that I will be analyzing and visualizing the cleaned Data to answer these questions:

* does the favorites and retweets in tweet have corrlation with its rating?
* how the populriaty of this account has icreased over time ?
* what are the top 100 rating dogs and thier type ?
* what are the probliblty of having golden etriever dog type in a new tweet ?
* what are the probliblty of hving the rate (14 or 13) given that the dog type is Labrador retriever ?

Dataset used from WeRateDogs, a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 9 million followers and has received international media coverage.
